# Two married grandparents, two daughters and sons-in-law and two children for each daughter.
#
#  I restricted spouses from giving to each other.
#  I also restricted the grand children from giving to their siblings or their own parents
#  and the middle generation parents from giving to their own children.
#
#  Maybe a tough challenge, but everyone should have had at least six people they could give to.
